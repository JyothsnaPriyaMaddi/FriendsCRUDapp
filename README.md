# FriendsCRUDapp
It is a simple SpringBoot application using HTTP methods, to add the friends, get the friends, delete the friends, update friends.

In POST method, we are creating new friends into the repository.
In GET method, we are fetching the friends stored in the repository.
In PUT method, we are updating already stored friends in the repository and saving the updated data.
In DELETE method, we are deleting the friends and saving in the repository.

In second commit, I used Pagination and Sorting.
Pagination means displaying the friends details in separate pages with required number of entities.
Sorting means arranging the entities in ascending or descending ways with respect to id, firstName, lastName, metDate
